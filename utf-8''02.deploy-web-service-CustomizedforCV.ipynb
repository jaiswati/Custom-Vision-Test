In this example, we'll use your estimated value to create a web service that computes the area of a circle in a real time. You'll learn about following concepts:\n\n**Model** is simply a file - or a folder of files - that model management service tracks and versions. Typically a model file would contain the coefficients of your trained model, saved to a file.  \n\n**Image** is a combination of model, a Python scoring script that tells how to load and invoke the model, and Python libraries used to execute that code. It is a self-contained unit that can be deployed as a service.\n\n**Service** is the image running on a compute. The service can be called from your front-end application to get predictions, either using the Azure ML SDK or raw HTTP."
